SDL2-idris
==========

SDL2 bindings package for idris

This package provides the following Modules

- Graphics.SDL2.SDL the low level bindings, mostly for SDL2 and SDL2_gfx
- Graphics.SDL2.Effect An idris Effect for the SDL2 bindings
- Graphics.Color a simple data type for colors

There are two very simple examples, for the monadic interface and the effects

The bindings were sort of tested using Mac OSX 10.9.5 using SDL2 2.0.3

Everything in this package was more or less ripped of and adapted from Edwin Brady's
SDL-Idris bindings for SDL 1 : https://github.com/edwinb/SDL-idris

Use at your own risk (If someone will ever read this)
